	      <param> defines as asyn driver parameter "name" that can be specified in an epics record to access data.		  
		  "access" is a comma separated list of how the shared variable is accessed: 
		             R (reader), BR (buffered reader), SR (single reader), W (writer), BW (buffered writer)
		  "type" is the asyn parameter type - single values need not be identical to the shared variable type, but
		          must be compatible (i.e. numeric if shared variable is numeric). Array types must match
                  in data type size, but need not match in signedness (EPICS does not have 
				  unsigned types). Valid values are: int32, float64, boolean, string, float32array, 
				  float64array, int8array, int16array, int32array - see @link NetShrVarConfig.xsd @endlink
		  "netvar" is the path to the shared variable - you can use / rather than \
		  "fval" and "tval" are only used for boolean type, they are the strings to be displayed for false and true values
		  "field" is only used for a structure type network shared variable, it indicates the structure element to access. Structures are read-only.

           I am not sure of we will get endian issue, but as double and int64 are same size this may get
           sorted out automatically -->

      <!-- CVI is not able to read a waveform data type, so a variant or structure/cluster must be used instead in labview
	       and a network variable of type variant created in either case -->
	  
      <!-- fields in a structure need to be indexed by number not name, only reading is supported
	       if you use "reorder controls in cluster" option for cluster in labview, you can see the 
		   field index to use, index starts at 0
		   
		   The whole shared variable structure updates at the same time, so you do not need to subscribe to 
           it for every item that reads a field. For example both struct_dt and struct_Y refer to the same
           network variable (but different fields) so only one item referring to the shared variable
		   (struct_dt in this case) needs to subscribe (access="R") and the other will get updated at the same time. 	   

           You can also use ts_param to refer to a structure member to be used for PV timestamp. As the whole structure
           shared variable is read at the same time, this may provide better synchronisation between timestamp and
           data - you can refer to a separate shared variable outside the structure, but you may not be guaranteed the
           variable for this timetamp is always updated in sync with the data variable.
