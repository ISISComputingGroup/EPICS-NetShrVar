##
## records for accessing shared variable alarm settings from EPICS.
##
## These are not necessary for records to go into alarm, rather they are needed
## if you wish to know or modify what the alarm levels are from EPICS
## For example the "cont1" parameter will go into HIHI alarm without needing
## these records, but if you wish to access from EPICS the level that has been set
## on the shared variable that caused it to go into
## HIHI alarm you would need records like this. Also if you wanted to change the
## HIHI alarm level without using the National Instruments interface you would need
## these records. Alarming via the shared variables is independent of the EPICS
## alarm system i.e HIHI and HHSV do not need to be set for it to work. If they are
## set then you will get the two alarm system competing. If you kept the two
## systems in sync by e.g. having some closed loop ao records to keep EPICS HIHI level
## and the national instruements HiHi alarm level at the same value then you may not see
## any issues.

## This reads the HiHi alarm level of the network variable referred to 
## via asyn parameter "cont1"
## This required alarming to be setup via NI distributed system manager
record(ai, "$(P)cont1_HiHi_level_RBV")
{
    field(DESC, "Alarm level")
    field(DTYP, "asynFloat64")
    field(INP,  "@asyn(nsv,0,0)cont1_HiHi_level")
    field(SCAN, "I/O Intr")
}

## This sets the HiHi alarm level of the network variable
record(ao, "$(P)cont1_HiHi_level")
{
    field(DESC, "Set Alarm level")
    field(DTYP, "asynFloat64")
    field(OUT,  "@asyn(nsv,0,0)cont1_HiHi_level")
}

## As well as _level you can access _Set, _deadband, _Enable, _Ack and _AckType of 
## shared variable Alarms.
